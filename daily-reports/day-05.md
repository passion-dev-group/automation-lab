# Day 5 - Design Your "System" on Paper

1. Created `SYSTEM_PLAN.md` to document the system design
   - Defined system inputs: Gmail + maybe forms later
   - Outlined processing: Python script that reads tasks from ClickUp, classifies, updates them
   - Specified outputs: ClickUp statuses, Discord/Slack notifications
   - Kept design simple and flexible for future evolution

2. Established high-level system architecture
   - Documented the flow from inputs → processing → outputs
   - Set foundation for future implementation phases
   - Created reference document for system planning
