1. I chosen Zapier and created a trigger and action
   - trigger: New email in Gmail. (label=AUTOMATION)
   - action: Create task in ClickUp in the `Incoming Tasks` list  
2. tested, and success!
  I sent an email to zapier's registered email from other email.
  after that I set the label name to "AUTOMATION".
  and I can see new task has been added!!!
