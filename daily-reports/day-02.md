# Day 2 - Learn ClickUp basics
1. In ClickUp:
   - Create a space: `Automation Sandbox`
   - Inside it, create a Folder: `Inbox`
   - Inside that, create a List: `Incoming Tasks`
2. Add 3 sample tasks manually:
   - Create `Lead: website redesign inquiry`
   - Create `Bug: Payment fails on checkout`
   - Create `Internal: Prepare weekly report`

# I am treating ClickUp as my central task database!
