# 🧠 Automation Lab

Welcome to **Automation Lab** — my personal sandbox for learning and building automation systems that streamline operations, manage tasks, and handle leads more efficiently.

## 🚀 Goal

To gain hands-on experience with automation tools such as **Zapier**, **Make.com**, and **ClickUp** while integrating them with services like **GitHub**, **Slack/Discord**, and other APIs.

This project focuses on building small but functional workflows that:
- Automate repetitive business tasks
- Sync data between tools (e.g., ClickUp ↔ Google Sheets ↔ Slack)
- Demonstrate practical use cases for no-code and low-code automation platforms

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack / Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **GitHub** | Version control & documentation |
| **ClickUp** | Task management and workflow tracking |
| **Zapier** or **Make.com** | Automation builder |
| **Slack / Discord** | Notifications & team updates |

---

## 🗓️ Learning Plan

### Week 1 – Setup & Foundations
**Goal:** Set up all tools, understand the basics, and design your first simple flow.

- **Day 1:** Create accounts for GitHub, ClickUp, and Zapier/Make.com  
- **Day 2–3:** Explore the basics of creating and testing automations  
- **Day 4–7:** Design your first simple workflow (e.g., “When a ClickUp task is created → send a Slack message”)  

---

## 🧠 Example Use Case

> “When a new task is created in ClickUp, automatically send a Slack message to the #tasks channel and log the task details in a Google Sheet.”

This is one of the first flows planned for Week 1.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

All learning progress and flow experiments will be tracked in ClickUp under the **Automation Lab** workspace.
