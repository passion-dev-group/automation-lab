# ⚙️ Automation Lab

> Building an **Operations Automation System** — connecting Python, ClickUp, Zapier/Make.com, and AWS to eliminate manual work.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This repository is my personal lab for learning and building **automation systems** that streamline operations using a combination of **Python scripts**, **no-code tools**, and **API integrations**.

By the end of this project, I’ll have a **fully working system** that automatically:
1. Receives input from emails, forms, or other sources  
2. Processes and enriches the data using Python  
3. Creates and updates tasks in ClickUp  
4. Sends notifications through Discord, Slack, or email  
5. Orchestrates everything through Zapier or Make.com  

This project also serves as a **portfolio-ready showcase** of automation engineering skills — ideal for roles like:
> 🧩 "Automation / Integration Engineer who glues tools + APIs + Python together and removes manual work."
